# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
We were 
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to explore the relationship between campaign launch date, fundraising goals, and success if any.  This analysis was focused on comparing other similar works to Louiseâ€™s, We narrowed the Kickstarter data to focus on similar projects to Louise's, specifically theater projects.  
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Our first analysis looked specifically at outcomes compared to the month of the year the campaign was started in.  According to our data set, we say a spike in May with successful campaigns.  The most successful campaigns start in May, with that number steadily dropping until September.  The lowest number of successful campaigns started in December. The image below shows successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters, and the month in which they started.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We also looked more broadly at goal size and what percentage of projects were successful,failed, or canceled.    
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
###Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Looking at this information, there was no point in the year as per our data where there were more failed projects that successful projects.  Based on the data we reviewed, most successful kickstarter campaigns for theater are started in May.  Between May and September is the most successful time of the year to start a kickstarter for theater, with December being the time where projects are more likely to fail.  This makes sense with the focus that fundraising receives around winter holidays, especially when Theater is competing against charitable giving.  
###Outcomes based on Goals?
The lower the goal, the more likely a project was to succeed. Generally we saw an inverse relationship between goal and success. For projects with goals between $10000 and $35000 we saw more failures than successes.  We saw that there were a sharp decline in the percentage of projects that succeeded starting at $40000 and dropping to its lowest point at $50000 or more. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Some limitations of this data set are its size, meaning it covered many types of kickstarters that weren't relavent to Louise's inquiry.  It did not have date information in a way that was accessible to excel. To find this information we did have to translate date information from an Apex to recognizable format. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other possible areas of interest for Louise would be
